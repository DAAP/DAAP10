\
DAAP10 has essentially  the same features as DAAP09. The major improvements are (1) the disambiguator is built in, the preDAAP program is no longer needed; (2) the treatment of short turns of speech (whether or not they should count as interruptions) is also built in, but can be overridden; and (3) the operator is prompted for the use of each category in the text file.\
\
There are also new output files; these are documented in the the help menu.}
